## Overview

This project demonstrates a minimal **proof-of-authenticity system** for AI-generated content.\
It uses **ChatGroq (Meta LLaMA)** to generate text and stores a **hash of the content in a local blockchain-like ledger**.\
Users can later verify if a piece of content was generated by the system and check the integrity of the ledger.

---

## Features

- Generate AI text using **ChatGroq** and record it in a tamper-evident ledger.
- Normalize and hash AI-generated content for consistent verification.
- Verify any pasted content against the ledger.
- Validate the integrity of the blockchain (detects tampering).
- Short, concise outputs (2-3 lines) for easy readability.

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Generated_Blockchain_Verification.git
cd AI_Generated_Blockchain_Verification
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set your GROQ_API_KEY in a `.env` file:

```bash
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

or set it in your environment variables.

---

## Usage

Run the main program:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Menu Options

- **Generate AI content & record** – Enter a prompt → AI generates text → stored in blockchain ledger.
- **Verify pasted content** – Paste any text → system checks if it exists in the ledger.
- **Check chain integrity** – Validates that the blockchain has not been tampered with.
- **Exit** – Exit the program.

## How It Works

1. **AI Generation** – A user prompt is sent to ChatGroq (Meta LLaMA), generating text output.
2. **Normalization & Hashing** – Text is normalized and hashed (SHA-256) to produce a content fingerprint.
3. **Blockchain Storage** – Each generated content is added as a block in a local blockchain ledger with:
   - `content_hash`
   - `timestamp`
   - `previous_hash`
   - `block_hash`
4. **Verification** – To verify any content, the system normalizes, hashes, and searches for the hash in the ledger.
5. **Integrity Check** – Each block links to the previous via hash. Any tampering will be detected during validation.

## Notes

- This is a **demo project**. For production:
  - Use a real blockchain or database for distributed storage.
  - Consider signing blocks with private keys.
  - Anchor ledger to a public blockchain for timestamp verification.
- The AI output is limited to 2-3 lines for brevity.
- The normalization step ensures minor formatting differences do not affect verification.

## Future Improvements

- Support **image-based AI content** with byte-hash storage.
- Add **digital signatures** for stronger proof.
- Deploy a **web interface** for easier user interaction.
- Integrate with **social media APIs** for automated verification.
